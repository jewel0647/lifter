Welcome to lifter's documentation!
======================================

Lifter is a lightweight query engine for Python iterables, inspired by Django ORM.

If you find if painful to gather data from collections of Python objects or dictionaries, such as API results, lifter is for you!

.. warning::

    This package is still in alpha state and a lot of work is still needed to make queries faster and efficient.
    Contributions are welcome :)
